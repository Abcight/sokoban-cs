## Motivation 🙌
This project used to serve as an entry for the [Motorola Science Cup](https://science-cup.pl) contest a couple years ago. It advanced my team to the next stage of the competition, and hasn't received much attention since.

## Features 🚀
The game contains around 30 stages, each with an assigned difficulty level. It also features a crude level editor and a challenge mode with a scoreboard.

Additionally, the game was developed according to a design document that has sadly been lost to time.
